You are a dot. 
Use the arrow keys to find your identical dot. Once you touch your identical dot, you grow, and become identical to another dot. (the dot you just touched disapears)
Once you are the only dot left, you move on to the next round. 
Find all the dots before the timer runs out!
Each round, the timer will go faster.
If you reach 0 seconds on the time, you lose. 
Have fun!
